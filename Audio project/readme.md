A JS audio themed project


This project is an attempt to aplly audio and audio controll via Js.
It is a project i will be working on over time.( given that doing it i started to have a bit of fun and want to do more)
A few things to note.{ there is a small issue m working on fixing  witht he audio and autp play(ull see when you look it over). maybe you can help me there. I will try to fix and commit it before the time is up

the next thing is that i plan to do more as i learn more so let me know if you want to seee the finsed project for this is a prototype.}



On a side note im haveing issues putting multiple audio file s in and have to play seperatly. i feel as if its a matter of how i do my play/pause button but if you have any adivce let me know.
